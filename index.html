                    <p>This is an up to 4 player fighting game where the players have kick each other off the screen while keeping their lives. Each player has 8 lives and they will not respawn once they are up however can enjoy the rest of the gameplay. The user must hit the 'A' button for a punch and 'D' button for a kick. Every player has a double jump by hitting the 'UP' button twice. Sockets are used in order for the other users to receive the information that would be emitted in real time.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Design:</h4>
                    <p>The classic will never go out of fashion! So a very pixel design has been implemented throughout the game. The main focus on the project is the multi-player and functionality of application. I would like to point out that all of the designs and spritesheets have been drawn/created using CAD programs.</p>

                    <p>There is a log-in/sign-up function in which the password is hashed and it would save the log-in in a cookie session. Once the user sign-up, they would be directed to their profile where they can add an image and edit the bio. Once the user log-in a notice is emitted to the other online users using sockets.io. Sockets are also used when the users disconnects and whenever the user has an updated in regards the friendship status (yes, even if someone declined a friend request or unfriend you -- villains like drama). The chat function will send an axios request to the server to get the latest 10 chats. The friendship button will change as soon as it is clicked and the database is updated accordingly. All the images have a click event. If you are clicking on your image, a pop-up modal will be displayed to change your image. If you are clicking on some other user image, it will direct you to their profile.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Design:</h4>
                    <p>As this is the social network for the villains, the pop colour must be poison green! The whole ecstatic is dark/mysterious and the background is on a brick wall, very similar to that found in alleyways as these are the parts most villains meet up. There are noticeable visual/sound features. These are: constant rain, flickering lighting/neon-lights, rolling thunder sounds and the images pictures are displayed as the shape of the eye that flickers once hovered on. The text is given the same pop of colour that contrasts with the background which makes it feel like these hacker devices villains may use to be off the radar.</p>

It also have a more button at the bottom which will disappear if there are less than 8 pictures left in the database. Once the image is clicked there will be a pop-up modal that will display the enlarged image and comment function. Once the modal is up, the URL can be shared and the user would be directed to the correct image.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Design:</h4>
                    <p>Very minimal, 2 hues approach has been chosen for this project. The background image is a canvas effect with paint slabs to give it some texture yet not distracting from the images. Hints Tangerine colour was chosen as this will spark your imagination and also provides you with energy gives the user a sense of inspiration. All of the images are uniform and grayscale to give it a sense of cleanliness. The images then turn to their original colour and an orange boarder is displayed on the hovered item. Note that the titles also change to the Tangerine colour once it is hovered on to give the user readability.</p>

                    <h4>AboutTheProject:</h4>
                    <p>As this was the first full-stack project, there was a lot to learn. There is a log-in/sign-up function in which the password is hashed and it would save the log-in in a cookie session. Once the user sign-up, they would be directed to the edit profile, where couple of personal questions are asked (this is not mandatory and can be edited later on). If the user did not log-out it will automatically direct the user to either sign the petition using the canvas feature or to the thank you page. From the thank you page, the user is able to edit the profile, delete the signature or to check out who else signed the petition. The petitioners page can also be filtered by clicking on the city or access the other users personal URL/website by clicking on the users' name.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Design:</h4>
                    <p>My petition was about the food trend of 'Tiny Plates'. This is very much reflected on the website. Pastel/translucent colours were used as they mirroring the society's perception of cuteness/dreamy and this is also reflected on the text styling, where the font is rather small. Most of the text is rotated sideways to represent the impracticality of the subject. On each page all of the information is mostly layered and gathered together to focus on the fact that the content is rather small.</p>
